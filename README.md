# Surge Stabilization

Codes from Alexandra Klufas' work in Summer 2017 as part of the Penn State Meterology REU program. Alex worked with SCRiM postdoc Tony Wong (now Instructor at CU-Boulder) and professor Klaus Keller (Geoscience).

These codes examine a network of long tide gauge data sites along the United States east coast. We calibrate generalized extreme value distributions and investigate the impacts of length of data record on (1) stabilization of estimates of the GEV distribution parameters, and (2) stabilization of estimates of the storm surge return levels.

This work is included as a supplement to [Wong et al. (2018)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aacb3d).
